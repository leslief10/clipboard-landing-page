## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I understand now the need for preprocessors. With previous projects, the code hasn't been as extensive, so I didn't consider it necessary, but a landing page is hundreds and hundreds of lines of code and it can be really messy if I use regular CSS. I also realized that in my need to reutilize code I created a lot of classes, which was a bit counterproductive.

### Continued development

I will look into using Sass for the next landing page project, and will work on analizing the code better so I don't create so many classes.
